    <p>On today's communications scene, it has become harder to stand out, especially when the market is already dominated by big players. Yet, one rising agency begs to differ, and is confidently claiming a piece of the cake: Around The Clock (ATC). In just four years, they went from a few employees to a multinational team of over 35 professionals. Tireless and fearless.</p>

    <h2>SMALL STEPS, STEADY GROWTH</h2>
    <p>ATC was first launched as a media services agency in Dubai, back in 2018, and it gradually evolved into a full-fledged communications agency with a tight-knit team spreading across the UAE and Lebanon. Unlike large communications groups who, at some point, get crippled by rigid decision-making processes and internal politics, ATC was an independent agency from day one � free to think and fast to act.</p>

    <h2>THE ART OF USING DATA</h2>
    <p>Around the Clockers decided to be, first and foremost, teachable: they would learn from failures, build on lessons, and constantly seek to better performance and results. They switched from being data-driven to data-informed, giving equal importance to data and human factors such as context, intuition and experience. With this approach, ATCers enable real-time optimization and empower the creative process to generate standout brand identities, solid strategies and impactful campaigns.</p>

    <h2>A STELLAR TEAM WITH BIG DREAMS</h2>
    <p>From a corporate culture perspective, ATC adopted a clear identity based on honesty, transparency, and family spirit, giving birth to a cohesive and dynamic team of free thinkers, whose biggest quality is hard work. They come from different backgrounds and speak different languages � some are rising talents, while others are seasoned experts with decades of industry experience. When you see them working together, it's quite hard to miss their synergy; the way they work and sync, like one integrated system.</p>

    <h2>PLAYING WITH THE BIG BOYS</h2>
    <p>Today, ATC has become one of the fastest growing, integrated-service communications firms in Dubai, offering a comprehensive suite of solutions, ranging from Creative Copy & Design, to Branding, Strategic Planning, Digital Advertising, Media Buying, Public Relations, Event Planning, and Social Media Management.</p>

    <h2>THE AGENCY OF THE FUTURE</h2>
    <p>With agility as its prime attribute, ATC continues to expand into new markets, always striving to become the agency of the future by diversifying its digital offerings and staying ahead of industry trends.</p>
